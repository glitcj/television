# VAIN Bishi Bashi + Freddie

## TODOs:
The following are the next imminent milestones to get through:
- Add AnimationPlayer duplicator in play_animation event
- Add GlobalAnimationPlayers to include parameterised animations like slide_in/out
- Restructure mutable variables in Variables as static classes (remove Variables as autolaod ?)
	
- Add standup VAIN, Stand-up takes args: "Topic", "Comedian", "Stance", Start with flashy splash, has generated laughter
- MAKE SHORTS and PUBLISH AUTOMATICALLY
- Stream VAIN to twitch/X, randomised unfolding dramatic VAIN.

## TV programs:
	- Stand up comedy, randomised roasts
	- Short Anime, randomised themes
	- Quiz show, randomised guests (plays itself, then make it playable)
	- Guess the ditto
	- Generated commercials
	- Second priority: talk show e.g., pilkington, cumia

## Other:
	 - Add LFS support
	 - Call order: Base definitions > _init(.) > initialise(.) > add_child() > "ready" signal > @onready > _ready()
	 - .new() makes object instances of .gd, Node, Object, class, or class_name
	 - .instantiate() makes object instances of PackedScene stored in .tscn files
