# VAIN: Visual AI Novel

## What is this ?
This game will generate a visual novel with selectable options from scratch. 


# Features
Things VAIN can generate:
	- Portraits of characters (with a few expressions, e.g., happy/sad)
	- Backgrounds
	- Text spanning a 10 minute playtime story
	- Some selectable options that locally change how the game behaves.
	
Vain can also summarise any book to a very short visual novel. 
E.g., Whiskers in the Marden, Kappa, etc.
	
All events developed in vain will help scale many other games. E.g., quiz show.
